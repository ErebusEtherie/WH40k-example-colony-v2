// Chronometer module for formatting a colony's founding age.
//
// The engine tracks colony age purely as elapsed "standard solar days"
// (colony.founding_days). No in-game calendar date / turn (year & quarter)
// is maintained anywhere — this module only converts those days into a
// human-readable years / months / days summary for display.

/**
 * Format a colony's founding age (in standard solar days) as readable text.

 * @param foundingDays - Number of days since the colony was founded.
 * @returns The formatted string plus decomposed years / months / days parts.
